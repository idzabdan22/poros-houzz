        This 3200 square foot home features a maintenance free exterior of LP Smartside,\n
        corrugated aluminum roofing, and native prairie landscaping. The design of the structure.\n
        is intended to mimic the architectural lines of classic farm buildings. The outdoor living.\n
        areas are as important to this home as the interior spaces; covered and exposed porches.\n
        field stone patios and an enclosed screen porch all offer expansive views of the surrounding meadow and tree line.\n
        The homeâ€™s interior combines rustic timbers and soaring spaces which would have traditionally been reserved for the barn and outbuildings.\n
        with classic finishes customarily found in the family homestead. Walls of windows and cathedral ceilings invite the outdoors in. Locally sourced\n
        reclaimed posts and beams, wide plank white oak flooring and a Door County fieldstone fireplace juxtapose with classic white cabinetry and millwork.

        RIn this combination living room/ family room, form vs function is at its best.. Formal enough to host a cocktail party, and\n
        comfortable enough to host a football game. The wrap around sectional accommodates 5-6 people and the oversized ottoman has room\n
        enough for everyone to put their feet up! The high back, stylized wing chair offers comfort and a lamp for reading.\n
        Decorative accessories are placed in the custom built bookcases freeing table top space for drinks, books, etc.\n
        Magazines and current reading are neatly placed in the rattan tray for easy access.\n
        The overall neutral color palette is punctuated by soft shades of blue around the room. LORRAINE G VALE photo by Michael Costa\n
        The lampshade - good example of what to find for the lamp with the pottery base for the livingroom

    <string name="desckitchen">
        This homes kitchen isnt large and needed to somehow hold a mudroom area as the detached garage enters into the space.\n
        I carefully planned out all storage needs and we were able to add a wide, double door cabinet closet by the back door.\n
        The upper area holds coats and clutter. The lower doors have hooks and boot trays for backpacks and shoes.\n
        Paneling the Subzero fridge helps with softening the weight of the large appliance, as does the panel on the dishwasher.\n
        Little details like the skirt on the toe area and the beautiful hood and island posts make this smaller work space truly special!\n
        light and bright; bottom of cabinets.
